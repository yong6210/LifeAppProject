# KPI-driven Feature Plan (v1.0)

## KPI Targets (Year 1)
- **Backup adoption**: ≥60% of monthly active users trigger at least one backup.
- **Premium conversion (trial → paid)**: ≥8% within 14 days.
- **Retention**: D30 retention ≥25%; routine completion rate ≥65%.

## KPI → Feature Mapping
| KPI | Levers | Planned Features |
| --- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Backup adoption | Awareness, ease, reminders | 
|  |  | 1. Weekly “Backup ready” reminder notification (opt-in).
|  |  | 2. Backup success badge + streak indicator on Account page.
|  |  | 3. Post-backup share sheet (“save log for records”). |
| Premium conversion | Paywall clarity, perceived value | 
|  |  | 1. Paywall copy test (focus vs backup value messaging) via Remote Config.
|  |  | 2. Limited-time promo code system (RevenueCat offerings).
|  |  | 3. Highlight premium-only presets and stats with gated preview. |
| Retention | Onboarding, habit formation, reminders | 
|  |  | 1. Quick-start widgets/shortcuts on Home.
|  |  | 2. Routine streak notifications + recap email (if user opts in).
|  |  | 3. Guided onboarding checklist (“Set focus preset”, “Turn on backup”). |

## Experiment & Measurement Plan
- Maintain experiment backlog in Notion with KPI impact estimate.
- Each experiment runs for ≥2 weeks or until statistically significant.
- Capture results in weekly data review sync.

## Prioritization Framework
1. Evaluate impact on primary KPIs using ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Effort).
2. Ensure at least one initiative per KPI per quarter.
3. Balance between quick wins (copy, reminders) and larger features (promo codes, guided onboarding).

## Feature Pipeline (next 2 sprints)
1. **Sprint N**: Backup reminder notification, paywall copy A/B test.
2. **Sprint N+1**: Account backup badge, streak notifications, premium preview cards.

## Ownership
- PM owns KPI roadmap, works with engineering/design to scope features.
- Analytics ensures instrumentation in place before launch.
- Support monitors qualitative feedback post-release for each initiative.

Update this plan quarterly based on KPI review outcomes.
